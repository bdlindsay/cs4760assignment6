Normal execution:
	make
	oss

	Description & Implementation Details:
	If throughput looks really low, please try running the program again and within a few runs it should have a more expected throughput. The display of which frames are currently allocated doesn't seem right. Adjustments to run specifications to have a smoother program run. Everything else as expected.
